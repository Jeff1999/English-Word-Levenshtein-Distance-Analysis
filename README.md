"Results Found (Graphs, Statistics, etc.)" is a folder than contains images for all of the analyses we conducted. 
This folder contains what you would typically see when you properly run our R file. 

"421ProjectLevenshteinDistance.R" is the R file we created to find our results.

"google-10000-english-no-swears.txt" is the text file that contains our dataset we used. This is the file our R file analyzed 
to find our results.
